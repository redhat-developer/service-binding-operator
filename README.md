## Introduction

The goal of the Service Binding Operator is to enable application authors to
import an application and run it on Kubernetes with services
such as databases represented as Kubernetes objects including Operator-backed and chart-based backing services, without having to perform manual configuration of `Secrets`,
`ConfigMaps`, etc.

To make a service bindable, the service provider needs to express
the information needed by applications to bind with the services. In other words, the service provider must express the
information that's “interesting” to applications.

There are multiple methods for making backing services
bindable, including the backing service provider providing metadata as
annotations on the resource. Details on the methods for making backing services bindable
are available in the [User Guide](docs/User_Guide.md).

To make an imported application (for example, a NodeJS application)
connect to a backing service (for example, a database):

* The app author (developer) creates a `ServiceBinding` and specifies:
  * The resource that needs the binding information. The resource can be
    specified by label selectors;
  * The backing service's resource reference that the imported application
    needs to be bound to;

* The Service Binding Controller then:
  * Reads backing service operator CRD annotations to discover the
    binding attributes
  * Creates a binding secret for the backing service, example, an operator-managed database;
  * Injects environment variables into the applications' `Deployment`, `DeploymentConfig`,
    `Replicaset`, `KnativeService` or anything that uses a standard PodSpec;

## Key Features

* Support Binding with backing services represented by Kubernetes resources including third-party CRD-backed resources.
* Support binding with multiple-backing services.
* Extract binding information based on annotations present in CRDs/CRs/resources.
* Extract binding values based on annotations present in OLM descriptors.
* Project binding values as volume mounts.
* Project binding values as environment variables.
* Binding of PodSpec-based workloads.
* Binding of non-PodSpec-based Kubernetes resources.
* Custom binding variables composed from one or more backing services.
* Auto-detect binding resources in the absence of binding decorators.

### Example
#### Binding a Java Application with a Database

``` yaml
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: binding-request
  namespace: service-binding-demo
spec:
  application:
    name: java-app
    group: apps
    version: v1
    resource: deployments
  services:
  - group: postgresql.baiju.dev
    version: v1alpha1
    kind: Database
    name: db-demo
    id: postgresDB
```

### Running Operator Locally

Clone the repository and run `make run` using an existing `kube:admin` kube context.

## Roadmap

The [Service Binding Operator roadmap uses the label roadmap](https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator/labels/roadmap) to track the direction of the project.

## Community, discussion, contribution, and support

The Service Binding community meets weekly on Thursdays at 1:00 PM UTC via [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/wsc-jjsy-eih).

Meeting Agenda is maintained [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HwhAKqpM6l4Ur3h3IApDFzbH2Y_xvj_n1x1pEdwRuSY/edit?usp=sharing)

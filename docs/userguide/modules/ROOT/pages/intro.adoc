= Introduction

Service Binding manages the data plane for applications and backing
services. Service Binding Controller reads data made available by the
control plane of backing services and projects the data to applications
according to the rules provided via ServiceBinding resource.

== Why Service Bindings?

Today in Kubernetes, the exposure of secrets for connecting applications
to external services such as REST APIs, databases, event buses, and many
more is manual and bespoke. Each service provider suggests a different
way to access their secrets, and each application developer consumes
those secrets in a custom way to their applications. While there is a
good deal of value to this flexibility level, large development teams
lose overall velocity dealing with each unique solution.

*Service Binding:* - Enables developers to connect their application to
backing services with a consistent and predictable experience - Removes
error-prone manual configuration of binding information - Provides
service operators a low-touch administrative experience to provision and
manage access to services - Enriches development lifecycle with a
consistent and declarative service binding method that eliminates
environments discrepancies

== Features

*Application Projection*

* Projection of binding data as file, with a volume mount
* Projection of binding data as environment variables

*Extracting Binding data from Services*

* Extract binding data based on annotations present in
CRDs/CRs/resources
* Extract binding data based on annotations present in OLM descriptors

*Service Binding Options*

* Cross-namespace binding
* Binding to a specific container of an application
* Custom path projection
* Secret substitution and mappings with Go Template
* Auto-detection of bindings in the absence of binding decorators
* Binding of PodSpec or non-PodSpec workloads
* Custom binding variables composed from one or more backing services

== Security

* RBAC support to opt-in

.Terminology
[sidebar]
--
Backing Service::
Any software that exposes functionality. Examples include a database, a
message broker, an application with REST endpoints, an event stream, an
Application Performance Monitor, or a Hardware Security Module.

Application::
Any process, running within a container. Examples include a Spring Boot
application, a NodeJS Express application, or a Ruby Rails application.
Note: This is different than an umbrella application as defined by the
Kubernetes SIG, which refers to a set of micro-services.

Service Binding::
The act of or representation of the action of providing information
about a Service to an Application

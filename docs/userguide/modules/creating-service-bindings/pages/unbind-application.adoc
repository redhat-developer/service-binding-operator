= Unbind Application

To unbind an application from a service, delete the `ServiceBinding`
custom resource linked to it using the `kubectl` or `oc` command line
tool:

[source,console]
----
kubectl delete ServiceBinding <.metadata.name>
----

OR

....
oc delete ServiceBinding <.metadata.name>
....

where `<.metadata.name>` is the name of the `ServiceBinding` resource.

Examples:

....
kubectl delete ServiceBinding binding-request
....

....
oc delete ServiceBinding binding-request
....

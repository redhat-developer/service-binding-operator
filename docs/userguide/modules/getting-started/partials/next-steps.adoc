By using service bindings, developers are able to more easily leverage
the services available to them on a Kubernetes cluster. This method provides
consistency across different services and is repeatable for the developers.
Service binding provides a unified way to create a binding connection between
the application and service and eliminates the need for the usual manual
and error-prone configuration.

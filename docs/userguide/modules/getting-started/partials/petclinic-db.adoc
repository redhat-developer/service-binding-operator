In this configuration, we leverage the {servicebinding-title} to collect the binding data from the PostgreSQL database and to project them into the Spring PetClinic application.

This scenario involves the following procedures:

. xref:#creating-a-postgresql-database-service[Creating {quickstart-db-showname} service].
. xref:#deploying-the-application[Deploying the Spring PetClinic application].
. xref:#connecting-the-application-to-the-database[Connecting the application to the database service using {servicebinding-title}].

Now, after the database is configured for the application, you can deploy the application and connect it to the database service.

[#deploying-the-application]

You can now use the {servicebinding-title} to connect the application to the database service.

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

In this scenario, we set up {quickstart-db-showname} and connected it to the Spring PetClinic application using the {servicebinding-title} to collect the binding data and expose them to the application.

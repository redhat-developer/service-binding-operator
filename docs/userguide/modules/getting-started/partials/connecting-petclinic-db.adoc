== Connecting the application to the database service with Service Binding Operator

[NOTE]
====
In the absence of the {servicebinding-title}, as an administrator of the application,
you must perform the following steps _manually_ to extract all the configuration details,
create a `Secret` resource, and expose it to the application through a volume mount in Kubernetes:

. Identify the required values for connecting the application to the database.
. Locate the resources where the values are present.
. Take the values from different resources and create a `Secret` resource.
. Mount the `Secret` resource into the application.
. Depending on the application requirement expose the values as environment variables or files.
====

To leverage the {servicebinding-title} as a way to easily and safely connect the sample application
to the database service, you must create a `ServiceBinding` custom resource (CR)
that triggers the {servicebinding-title} to project the binding data into the application:

+++ <details><summary> +++
`ServiceBinding` resource to project the binding data 
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,yaml]
----
include::attachment$petclinic-{quickstart-db}-binding.yaml[tag=service-binding]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

The `.spec` field of the `ServiceBinding` CR has two sections:

* The first section is a list of service resources (`.spec.services`). The services resources point to the database service resources. For more information on how the values are exposed from the service resources, see the xref:exposing-binding-data:intro-expose-binding.adoc[Exposing Binding Data] section.
* The second section is the application (`.spec.application`). The application points to a `Deployment` or any resource that is compliant with PodSpec.

=== Procedure

. Create the `ServiceBinding` CR by running the following command in shell:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
kubectl apply -f link:{attachmentsdir}/petclinic-{quickstart-db}-binding.yaml[pass:a[{site-url}/{page-component-name}/{page-module}/{attachmentsdir}/petclinic-{quickstart-db}-binding.yaml]] -n {quickstart-namespace}
----
+
. Verify that the request for service binding is successful by running the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
kubectl get servicebindings -n {quickstart-namespace}
----
+
.Example output:
[source,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
NAME                          READY   REASON              AGE
spring-petclinic-{quickstart-db}   True    ApplicationsBound   28s
----
+
[NOTE]
====
By creating this `ServiceBinding` resource, we now have the binding data values from the
database that is to be projected into the application container as
files, by default. Alternatively, you can also choose to project the binding data values as environment
variables if you prefer. If you check under the
`/bindings/spring-petclinic-{quickstart-db}` directory, you can see all the values
from the `Secret` resource projected there.

In the case of the previous example, you can find `username` and `password` as the projected values.
The values pointed out through the annotation are also projected, such as the `database`, `host`,
and `port` values. For connectivity, the `type` value is projected as the binding data.

The application looks for the `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable to
find the location of the `/bindings` directory. The Spring Boot application
used here uses the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bindings[Spring Cloud Bindings] library
and it looks for the `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable to get the projected
binding data. For more information on how an application uses these values, 
see the xref:using-projected-bindings:using-projected-bindings.adoc[Using Projected Bindings] section.
====
+
. Verify that the binding is successful by setting up the port forwarding
from the application port to access the sample application from your local environment:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/spring-petclinic 8080:80 -n {quickstart-namespace}
----
+
.Example output:
+
[source,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:8080 -> 8080
----
+
. Access http://localhost:8080.
+
You can now remotely access web UI of the application and see
that the application is now connected to the database service.

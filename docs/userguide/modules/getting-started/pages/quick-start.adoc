= Quick Start Guide

The goal of this quick start guide is to:

* Provide an overview of Service Binding Operator.
* Provide a list of prerequisites to be configured on your Kubernetes
cluster.
* Create a PostgreSQL database instance
* Deploy the application
* Connect the application to the database with Service Binding

For this quick start, we are using a PostgreSQL database and a simple
application using the
https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest[Spring Boot
REST API server] sample. This will allow you to understand how Service
Binding Operator can be used to simplify the connection between a
service, like a database and the application.

To illustrate what we are going to do, here is a visual representation
of the application we are going to setup.

image:postgresql-spring-boot.png[postgresql-spring-boot]

In this configuration, we leverage the service binding operator, to
collect the binding data from the PostgreSQL database and project them
into the sample application.

Before starting, we invite you to refer to the
xref:#prerequisites[] section to make sure you have all the
needed components configured on your K8s cluster.

The quick start consists of three main steps:

. link:#create-a-postgresql-database-instance[Create a PostgreSQL
database instance]
. link:#deploy-the-sample-application[Deploy the application]
. link:#connect-the-application-to-the-database[Connect the application
to the database with Service Binding]

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

In order to follow the quick start, you’ll need the following tools
installed and configured:

* Kubernetes cluster

NOTE: You can use
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[minikube] or
https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind], locally

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl]
* PostgreSQL client (`psql` CLI tool)
* xref:installing-service-binding.adoc[]

[#create-a-postgresql-database-instance]
== Create a PostgreSQL database instance

The application is going to use to a PostgreSQL database backend which
can be setup using the `v5` channel of
https://operatorhub.io/operator/postgresql[Crunchy PostgreSQL operator
from OperatorHub.io]. We just need to make sure that the operator is
availabe in our `my-postgresql` namespace.

The installation of the operator doesn’t create a database instance
itself, so we need to create one.

. To create a database instance, you need to create custom resource
`PostgresCluster` and that will trigger the operator reconciliation. For
convenience, run this command to create `PostgresCluster` custom
resource:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
kubectl apply -f link:{attachmentsdir}/pgcluster.yaml[pass:a[{site-url}/{page-component-name}/{page-module}/{attachmentsdir}/pgcluster.yaml]]
----

. Once the database is created, we need to ensure all the pods in
`my-postgresql` namespace are running (it will take few minutes):
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pod -n my-postgresql
----
+
You should see output something like this:
+
[source,terminal]
....
NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
hippo-backup-6th6--1-28849               0/1     Completed   0          1m
hippo-instance1-sl4r-0                   2/2     Running     0          2m
hippo-pgbouncer-8454474bc7-lhcn9         2/2     Running     0          2m
pgo-84b9679484-79c6m                     1/1     Running     0          3m
....
+
The database has been created and is empty at this stage. We now need to
set its schema and we will also project a sample data set, so we can
play around with the application.

. You can initialize the database with the schema and sample data using
this command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
curl -sL link:{attachmentsdir}/init-database.sh[pass:a[{site-url}/{page-component-name}/{page-module}/{attachmentsdir}/init-database.sh]] | bash
----
+
We have now finished to configured the database for the application. We
are ready to deploy the sample application and connect it to the
database.

[#deploy-the-sample-application]
== Deploy the sample application

In this section, we are going to deploy the application on our
kubernetes cluster. For that, we will use a deployment configuration and
do the configuration of our local environment to be able to test the
application.

. Deploy the `spring-petclinic-rest` app with this `Deployment`
configuration:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
kubectl apply -f link:{attachmentsdir}/app-deployment.yaml[pass:a[{site-url}/{page-component-name}/{page-module}/{attachmentsdir}/app-deployment.yaml]]
----

. Let’s now setup the port forwarding from the application port so we
can access it from our local environment
+
[source,bash]
....
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/spring-petclinic-rest 9966:80 -n my-postgresql
....

. You should be able to open http://localhost:9966/petclinic and see a
https://swagger.io[Swagger UI] where you can play with the API.

At this stage, the application is not yet connected to the database. So,
if you try to play around the APIs, you’ll see errors returned by the
application.

For example, if you try to access the list of all pets, you can see an
error like this:

[source,bash]
....
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api/pets" -H "accept: application/json"

{"className":"org.springframework.transaction.CannotCreateTransactionException","exMessage":"Could
not open JPA EntityManager for transaction; nested exception is
org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException: Unable to acquire JDBC
Connection"}
....

Now, we are going to see how you can use Service Binding to easily
connect the application to the database.

[#connect-the-application-to-the-database]
== Connect the application to the database

Suppose the Service Binding operator is not present. In that case, the
application’s admin needs to extract all the configuration details and
create a Secret resource and expose it to the application through volume
mount in Kubernetes. The steps would be something like this:

. Identify the required values for connecting the application to the
database
. Locate the resources where the values are present
. Take the values from different resources and create a Secret resource
. Mount the Secret resource into the application
. Depending on the application requirement the values should be exposed
as env var or file.

In this quick start, we are going to leverage Service Binding as a way
to easily and safely connect the application to the database service. In
order to do that, we’ll need to create a Service Binding resource which
will trigger the Service Binding Operator to project the binding datas
into the application.

. Create the ServiceBinding resource to project the binding data:
+
The `.spec` has two sections. The first is a list of service
resources (`.spec.services`), and the second one is the application
(`.spec.application`). The services resources points to the database’s
service resources. How the values are exposed from service resources are
explained xref:exposing-binding-data:intro-expose-binding.adoc[]
section. The application points to a `Deployment`
or any resource that is PodSpec compatible.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic-rest
  namespace: my-postgresql
spec:
  services:
    - group: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com
      version: v1beta1
      kind: PostgresCluster
      name: hippo
  application:
    name: spring-petclinic-rest
    group: apps
    version: v1
    resource: deployments
----
+
For simplicity, you can copy/paste the following command to create the
resource:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
kubectl apply -f link:{attachmentsdir}/service-binding.yaml[pass:a[{site-url}/{page-component-name}/{page-module}/{attachmentsdir}/service-binding.yaml]]
----
+
To check if the binding was successful you can check the binding
resource status conditions by the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get servicebindings spring-petclinic-rest -n my-postgresql -o jsonpath-as-json='{.status.conditions}'
----
+
You should see output something like:
+
[source,json]
----
[
  [
    {
      "lastTransitionTime": "2021-09-06T13:42:28Z",
      "message": "",
      "reason": "DataCollected",
      "status": "True",
      "type": "CollectionReady",
    },
    {
      "lastTransitionTime": "2021-09-06T13:42:28Z",
      "message": "",
      "reason": "ApplicationUpdated",
      "status": "True",
      "type": "InjectionReady",
    },
    {
      "lastTransitionTime": "2021-09-06T13:42:28Z",
      "message": "",
      "reason": "ApplicationsBound",
      "status": "True",
      "type": "Ready",
    },
  ],
]
----
+
To learn more about creating service bindings, you can find more
information on the following xref:creating-service-bindings:creating-service-binding.adoc[document]
+
By creating this `Service Binding` resource, we now have values from the
database’s binding data projected into the application container as
files (that’s the default behavior, but you can also project environment
variables if you prefer). If you check under
`/bindings/spring-petclinic-rest` directory you’ll see all the values
from the secret resource projected there. In the above example, you’ll
find `username` and `password`. And the values pointed out through the
annotation are also projected which includes `database`, `host`, and
`port`. Finally `type` is also projected which is required for
connectity.. The application looks for `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` env var to
find the location of `/bindings` directory. The Spring Boot application
used here is built using
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bindings[Spring Cloud
Bindings] and it looks for `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` to get the projected
binding data. See the using projected binding data section about how the
values can be used from the application.
+
To verify that binding was successful and that the files in the
application contain the expected content, you can use the following script to
inspect the deployment:
+
[source,bash]
----
for i in username password host port type; do
  kubectl exec -it deploy/spring-petclinic-rest -n my-postgresql -- /bin/bash -c 'find /bindings/*/'$i' -exec echo -n {}:" " \; -exec cat {} \;';
  echo
done
----
+
You should see output something like:
+
[source,bash]
....
/bindings/spring-petclinic-rest/username: hippo
/bindings/spring-petclinic-rest/password: w0ZB<0j1W|K;+4*TlK7-w^z/
/bindings/spring-petclinic-rest/host: hippo-pgbouncer
/bindings/spring-petclinic-rest/port: 5432
/bindings/spring-petclinic-rest/type: postgresql
....

. Let’s now check how the application is behaving and setup the port
forwarding of the application port to access it from our local
environment
+
[source,bash]
....
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/spring-petclinic-rest 9966:80 -n my-postgresql
....

. Open http://localhost:9966/petclinic, you should see a
https://swagger.io[Swagger UI] where you can play with the API.
+
If you try to access list of all pets, you can see the application is
now connected to the database and see the sample data initially
configured:
+
[source,bash]
....
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api/pets" -H "accept: application/json"
[{"id":1,"name":"Leo","birthDate":"2000/09/07","type":{"id":1,"name":"cat"},
"owner":{"id":1,"firstName":"George","lastName":"Franklin","address":"110...
....

== Next Steps

In this sample, we setup a database and connected it to an application
using the Service Binding operator to collect the connection metadata
and expose them to the application.

By using service bindings, developers are able to more easily leverage
the services available to them on a Kubernetes cluster. This method
provides consistency accross different services and is repeatable for
the developers. By remove the usual manual and error prone
configuration, they benefit from a unified way to do
application-to-service linkage.

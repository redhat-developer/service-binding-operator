[#installing-the-sbo-using-helm-chart]
== Installing the Service Binding Operator using Helm chart

The Helm chart installation involves the following steps:

1. xref:#adding-the-helm-chart-repository[Adding the `service-binding-operator-helm-chart` repository].
2. xref:#installing-the-helm-chart[Installing the Service Binding Operator Helm chart].
3. xref:#running-a-helm-test[Running a Helm test].


[NOTE]
====
If you are not installing the {servicebinding-title} through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), you must install cert-manager on the cluster. Installing the cert-manager automates TLS certificates for Kubernetes and OpenShift workloads. Cert-manager ensures that the certificates are valid and up-to-date, and attempts to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry. You can install cert-manager by running the following command:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.6.0/cert-manager.yaml
----
====

.Prerequisites:

. You have access to a Kubernetes or an OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
. You have the cert-manager installed on the cluster if you are not installing the {servicebinding-title} through OLM.
. You have installed the Helm CLI.
. You have installed the `kubectl` or `oc` CLI.

[#adding-the-helm-chart-repository]
== Adding the Helm chart repository
. Add the `service-binding-operator-helm-chart` repository to your local repository and name the repository as per your convenience:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add service-binding-operator-helm-chart https://redhat-developer.github.io/service-binding-operator-helm-chart/
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
"service-binding-operator-helm-chart" has been added to your repositories
----
+
. Verify your Helm repository by listing it:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm repo list
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                 	                        URL
service-binding-operator-helm-chart          	https://redhat-developer.github.io/service-binding-operator-helm-chart/
----
+
The output verifies that the `service-binding-operator-helm-chart` repository is added to your local Helm repository.

[#installing-the-helm-chart]
== Installing the Helm chart
. Search the repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm search repo service-binding-operator-helm-chart
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                                            CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
service-binding-operator-helm-chart/service-binding-operator    1.0.0        	1.0.1      	A Helm chart to deploy service binding operator
----
+
. Create a Helm chart release and specify the namespace required with the `--create-namespace` flag:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm install service-binding-operator-release \
service-binding-operator-helm-chart/service-binding-operator \
--namespace service-binding-operator --create-namespace
----
+
. Optional: If you wish to install the chart on the default namespace, remove the `--namespace` and `--create-namespace` flags.
+
[NOTE]
====
As part of the Helm test, objects such as deployment, service binding resources, and secrets used for testing the Operator are deleted.
====
. Optional: To view the  resources created for testing, install the chart with the `keepTestResources` flag value set to `true`:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm install service-binding-operator-release \
service-binding-operator-helm-chart/service-binding-operator \
--namespace service-binding-operator --create-namespace \
--set keepTestResources=true
----

[#running-a-helm-test]
== Running a Helm test
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing the chart on the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster, then perform the following steps:

. Modify the `aws-auth` config map:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl edit -n kube-system cm/aws-auth
----
+
. Add `-system:masters` to mapRoles and save.
. After editing the config map, update the EKS `kubeConfig` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name>
----
+
. Continue with the following steps.
====
. Create a `my-k-config` secret and specify the required namespace from your `kubeconfig` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic my-k-config --from-file=kubeconfig=<PATH TO YOUR KUBECONFIG> --namespace service-binding-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
secret/my-k-config created
----
+
The output verifies that the `my-k-config` secret is created.
. Run the Helm test and specify the namespace if applicable:
+
[source,bash]
----
helm test service-binding-operator-release --namespace service-binding-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME: service-binding-operator-release

Phase:          Succeeded
----
+
The `Succeeded` phase from the output indicates that the Helm test has run successfully.
. Verify that the Helm test has run successfully:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods --namespace service-binding-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                    READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
service-binding-operator-release-test   0/1     Completed   0          4m28s
----
+
The output verifies that you have successfully installed the {servicebinding-title} using a Helm chart and are able to bind your workload to backing services.
. As a safety measure, delete the secret created and specify the namespace if applicable:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete secret my-k-config  --namespace service-binding-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
secret/my-k-config deleted
----
+
The output verifies that the secret you had created is now deleted.
+
[NOTE]
====
Deleting the secret avoids exposing the secret credentials of the cluster to which you are connected.

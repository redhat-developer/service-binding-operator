= Direct Secret Reference

When a resource is not available as a Provisioned Service, but there is
a `Secret` service resource available for binding, use the
https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#direct-secret-reference[Direct
Secret Reference] method. In this method, a `ServiceBinding` resource
directly references a `Secret` service resource to connect to a service.
All the keys in the `Secret` service resource are exposed as binding
metadata.

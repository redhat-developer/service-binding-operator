[#direct-secret-reference]
= Direct secret reference

When a resource is not available as a Provisioned service, but all the required binding data values are available in a `Secret` resource that you can reference in your Service Binding definition, use the https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#direct-secret-reference[Direct secret reference] method. In this method, a `ServiceBinding` resource directly references a `Secret` resource to connect to a service. All the keys in the `Secret` resource are exposed as binding data.

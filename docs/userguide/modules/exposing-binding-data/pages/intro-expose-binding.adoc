= Introduction

Connecting applications to backing services is always a challenge as
each service provider suggests a different way to access their secrets
and consume them in an application. Service Binding helps the developers
by providing a consistent and predictable experience and removes
error-prone usual manual steps to configure the binding between an
application and backing services.

For the Service Binding Operator to provide the binding data, the
backing services must expose the binding data in a way that can be
detected by Service Binding Operator.

Binding data is exposed for the following scenarios:

* *The backing service is considered as a
https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#provisioned-service[Provisioned
Service]* resource: The service you intend to connect to, is compliant
with the Service Binding specification and the detection of all the
binding data values is automatic.
* *The backing service is not a
https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#provisioned-service[Provisioned
Service]* resource: You must expose the binding data from the backing
service. You can expose the binding data using any of the following
methods:
** *https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#direct-secret-reference[Direct
Secret Reference]*: When all the required binding values are available
in a `Secret` that you can reference in your Service Binding definition.
** *Generate Secret through CRD or CR annotations*: When you can
annotate the resources of the backing service, to expose the binding
data with specific annotations.
** *Generate Secret through OLM descriptors*: when you can provide OLM
descriptors, if the backing service is provided by an Operator.
** *Detect Binding data through owned resources*: when the backing
service owns Kubernetes resources such as `Service`, `Route`,
`ConfigMap` or `Secret` that you can use to detect the binding data.

Service Binding Operator implements support for https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/blob/master/extensions/secret-generation.md[Secret Generation Extension]
and hence provides the ability to expose the values from
the backing service resources. You can use the following methods to map
and expose the binding data:

* Expose a string from a resource
* Expose a constant value
* Expose an entire ConfigMap or Secret that is referenced from a
resource
* Expose a specific entry from a ConfigMap or Secret that is referenced
from a resource
* Expose entries from a collection of objects, mapping keys and values
from entries in a ConfigMap or Secret that is referenced from a resource
* Expose a collection of specific entry values in a resourceâ€™s
collection of objects
* Map each value to a specific key
* Map each value of a collection to a key with a generated name

== Data Model

This section explains the data model used in the annotation and OLM
descriptors. The data model is same for CRD or CR annotations and OLM
descriptors, but the syntax is different, which is explained in the
respective sections.

* `path`: JSONPath template is composed of JSONPath expressions enclosed by curly braces {}.
The behaviour matches https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath[kubectl JSONPath support]
* `elementType`: Specifies whether the value of the element referenced
in `path` complies with any one of the following types `string` or
`sliceOfStrings` or `sliceOfMaps`. Defaults to `string` if `elementType`
is not specified.
* `objectType`: Specifies whether the value of the element indicated in
`path` refers to a `ConfigMap`, `Secret` or a plain string in the
current namespace. Defaults to `Secret` if `objectType` is not specified
and `elementType` is non-string.
* `sourceKey`: Specifies the key in the ConfigMap or Secret that is to
be added to the binding Secret. When used in conjunction with
`elementType`=`sliceOfMaps`, `sourceKey` specifies the key in the slice
of maps whose value would be used as a key in the binding Secret. This
optional field can be used if the operator author intends to express
that when a specific field in the referenced `Secret` or `ConfigMap` is
bindable. All values from `Secret` or `ConfigMap` are exposed if
`sourceKey` is not specified.
* `sourceValue`: Specifies the key in the slice of maps whose value
would be used as the value, corresponding to the value of the
`sourceKey` that is added as the key, in the binding Secret. Mandatory
only if `elementType` is `sliceOfMaps`.

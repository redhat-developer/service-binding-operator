= Provisioned service

https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#provisioned-service[Provisioned service] represents a backing service CR with a reference to a `Secret` resource placed in the `.status.binding.name` field of the backing service CR.

As an Operator provider or the user who creates backing services, you can use this method to be compliant with the Service Binding specification, by creating a `Secret` resource and referencing it in the `.status.binding.name` section of the backing service CR. This `Secret` resource must provide all the binding data values required for a workload to connect to the backing service.

The following examples show an `AccountService` CR that represents a backing service and a `Secret` resource referenced from the CR.

.Example: `AccountService` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: AccountService
name: prod-account-service
spec:
  ...
status:
  binding:
    name: production-db-secret
----

.Example: Referenced `Secret` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: production-db-secret
data:
  password: "MTBz"
  user: "Z3Vlc3Q="
  ...
----

When creating a service binding resource, you can directly give the details of the `AccountService` resource in the `ServiceBinding` specification as follows:

.Example: `ServiceBinding` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: account-service
spec:
  ...
  services:
  - group: "example.com"
    version: v1alpha1
    kind: AccountService
    name: prod-account-service
  application:
    name: nodejs-app
    group: apps
    version: v1
    resource: deployments
----

.Example: `ServiceBinding` resource in Specification API
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: servicebinding.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: account-service
spec:
  ...
  service:
    apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: AccountService
    name: prod-account-service
  workload:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nodejs-app
----

This method exposes all the keys in the `production-db-secret` referenced `Secret` resource as binding data that is to be projected into the workload.

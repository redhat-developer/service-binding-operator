= Adding Binding Data as OLM Descriptors

Use this method if you are distributing operators not created by you.
You can distribute the operator as an
https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/blob/master/docs/design/operator-bundle.md[Operator
Bundle]. You can add
https://github.com/openshift/console/blob/master/frontend/packages/operator-lifecycle-manager/src/components/descriptors/reference/reference.md[OLM
descriptors] to describe the binding data that is to be exposed. The OLM
descriptors are part of
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.html[Cluster
Service Version] files. You can expose the binding data by using
`specDescriptors` array and StatusDescriptors. The `specDescriptors`
array specifies a path under the `.spec` section of a custom resource.
The `statusDescriptors` array specifies a path under the `.status`
section of a custom resource.

The Service Binding Operator detects the OLM descriptors and project the
values into the application.

Following are the only two fields that are used for binding the
metadata:

* Path: A dot-delimited path of the field on the object as described by
the descriptor.
* X-Descriptors: Defines the binding data.

The following examples show how to define an X-Descriptor depending on
the resource to which you point the path:

== Example: X-Descriptor definition for the path pointing to a Secret service resource

....
- path: data.dbCredentials
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:Secret
  - service.binding
....

Similary, if the path is pointing to a `ConfigMap` resource, there
should be an X-Descriptors defined like this:

....
- path: data.dbConfiguration
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap
  - service.binding
....

*Note:*

* You must have a `service.binding` entry in the X-Descriptors to
identify that it is a configuration for service binding.
* Absence of the `Secret` or `ConfigMap` specific X-Descriptors
indicates that the descriptor is referencing the binding data value at
the given path.

== Exposing an entire Secret as the binding Secret

If you are projecting all the values from a `Secret` service resource,
you must specify it as an attribute in the backing service custom
resource. For example, if the attribute is part of the `.spec` section,
you can create and use a `specDescriptors` array. Or, if the attribute
is part of the `.status` section, you can create and use a
`statusDescriptors` array.

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, create an entry to indicate that the path
points to the `Secret` service resource.

== Example: Configuration with a urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:Secret entry

....
- path: data.dbCredentials
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:Secret
  - service.binding
....

== Exposing an entire ConfigMap as the binding Secret

If you are projecting all the values from a `ConfigMap` service
resource, you must specify it as an attribute in the backing service
custom resource. For example, if the attribute is part of the `.spec`
section, you can create and use a `specDescriptors` array. Or, if the
attribute is part of the `.status` section, you can create and use a
`statusDescriptors` array.

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, create an entry to indicate that the path
points to the `ConfigMap` service resource.

== Example: Configuration with a urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap entry

....
- path: data.dbConfiguration
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap
  - service.binding
....

== Exposing an entry from a ConfigMap into the binding Secret

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, update `X-Descriptors` for
`service.binding` and `sourceKey` by providing the following
information:

* name of the binding key that is to be projected
* name of the key in the Secret service resource

== Example: Configuration with a urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap entry

....
- path: data.dbConfiguration
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap
  - service.binding:my_certificate:sourceKey=certificate
....

In the previous example, `sourceKey` points to the name of the key in
the Secret resource, which is `certificate`. And `my_certificate` is the
name of the binding key that is going to be projected.

== Exposing an entry from a Secret into the binding Secret

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, update `X-Descriptors` for
`service.binding` and `sourceKey` by providing the following
information:

* name of the binding key that is to be projected
* name of the key in the Secret service resource

== Example: Configuration with a urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:Secret entry

....
- path: data.dbConfiguration
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:Secret
  - service.binding:my_certificate:sourceKey=certificate
....

In the previous example, `sourceKey` points to the name of the key in
the Secret resource, which is `certificate`. And `my_certificate` is the
name of the binding key that is going to be projected.

== Exposing a resource definition value into the binding Secret

If values required for binding to the backing service are available as
attributes of its resources, you can annotate these values, using
`X-Descriptors`.

* Annotating the values identifies them as the binding data.
* Content for Procedure:

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, update `X-Descriptors` with the required
resource definition value.

== Example: The connectionURL attribute pointing to the uri value

....
- path: data.connectionURL
  x-descriptors:
  - service.binding:uri
....

In the previous example, the `connectionURL` attribute points to the
required value that is to be projected as `uri`.

== Exposing the entries of a collection into the binding Secret selecting the key and value from each entry

* Content for Procedure:

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, update `X-Descriptors` for the required
entries of a collection.

== Example: Configuration from a backing service resource

....
status:
  connections:
    - type: primary
      url: primary.example.com
    - type: secondary
      url: secondary.example.com
    - type: '404'
      url: black-hole.example.com
....

The previous example helps you to project all those values with key such
as `primary`, `secondary`, and so on.

== Example: Configuration for the required entries of a collection

....
- path: bootstrap
  x-descriptors:
  - service.binding:endpoints:elementType=sliceOfMaps:sourceKey=type:sourceValue=url
....

== Exposing the items of a collection into the binding Secret with one key per item

* Content for Procedure:

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, update `X-Descriptors` for the required
items of a collection.

== Example: Configuration from a backing service resource

....
spec:
    tags:
      - knowledge
      - is
      - power
....

The previous example helps you project all those values with key such as
`prefix_0`, `prefix_1`, and so on. The default prefix is the name of the
resource kind:

== Example: Configuration for the required items of a collection

....
- path: spec.tags
  x-descriptors:
  - service.binding:tags:elementType=sliceOfStrings
....

== Exposing the values of collection entries into the binding Secret with one key per entry value

* Content for Procedure:

[arabic]
. Using the `path` attribute, update `X-Descriptors` for the required
values of collection entries.

== Example: Configuration from a backing service resource

....
spec:
    connections:
      - type: primary
        url: primary.example.com
      - type: secondary
        url: secondary.example.com
      - type: '404'
        url: black-hole.example.com
....

The previous example helps you project all those values with key such as
`prefix_0`, `prefix_1`, and so on. The default prefix is the name of the
resource kind:

== Example: Configuration for the required values of collection entries

....
- path: bootstrap
  x-descriptors:
  - service.binding:endpoints:elementType=sliceOfStrings:sourceValue=url
....

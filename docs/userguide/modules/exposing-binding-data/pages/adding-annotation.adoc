[#declaring-binding-data-through-CRD-or-CR-annotations]
= Declaring binding data through CRD or CR annotations

If your backing service is not compliant with the Service Binding specification as a {provisioned-service} resource, you can annotate the
resources of the backing service to expose the binding data with specific annotations. Adding annotations under the `metadata` section alters the CR and {crd} of the backing services.

The {servicebinding-title} implements support for {secret-generation-extension}. The {servicebinding-title} detects the annotations added to the CRs and CRDs and then creates a `Secret` resource with the values extracted based on the annotations.

The following examples show the annotations that are added under the `metadata` section and a referenced `ConfigMap` object and `Secret` object from a resource:

.Example: Exposing binding data from a `Secret` object defined in the CR annotations
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.example.org/v1beta1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: db
  namespace: my-petclinic
  annotations:
    service.binding: 'path={.metadata.name}-cred,objectType=Secret'
    ...
----

The previous example places the name of the secret name in the `{.metadata.name}-cred` template that resolves to `db-cred`. The template can contain multiple JSONPath expressions.

.Example: Referenced `Secret` object from a resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-cred
data:
  password: "foo"
  user: "guest"
----

.Example: Exposing binding data from a `ConfigMap` object defined in the CR annotations
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.example.org/v1beta1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: db
  namespace: my-petclinic
  annotations:
    service.binding: 'path={.metadata.name}-config,objectType=ConfigMap'
    ...
----

The previous example places the name of the config map in the `{.metadata.name}-config` template that resolves to `db-config`. The template can contain multiple JSONPath expressions.

.Example: Referenced `ConfigMap` object from a resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: db-config
data:
  db_timeout: "10s"
  user: "db1"

[#exposing-a-specific-entry-from-a-config-map-or-secret-referenced-from-a-resource]
== Exposing a specific entry from a config map or secret that is referenced from a resource
The following example shows how to expose a specific entry from a config map through annotations:

.Example: Exposing `db_timeout` entry from a config map through annotations
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.example.org/v1beta1

  annotations:
    service.binding: 'path={.metadata.name}-config,objectType=ConfigMap,sourceKey=db_timeout'
----

.Example: The referenced config map from the backing service resource
The binding data should have a key with name as `db_timeout` and value as `10s`:
[source,yaml]

kind: Database
metadata:
  name: my-db
  annotations:
    "service.binding/user": "path={.status.data.dbCredentials},objectType=Secret,sourceKey=username"
spec:
  ...

status:
  data:
    dbCredentials: db-cred <1>

[#exposing-a-resource-definition-value]
== Exposing a resource definition value
The following example shows how to expose a resource definition value through annotations:

.Example: Exposing `status.data.connectionURL` resource value as `uri` binding item
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.example.org/v1beta1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: my-db
  annotations:
    "service.binding/uri":  "path={.status.data.connectionURL}"
spec:
  ...

status:
  data:
    connectionURL: "http://guest:secret123@192.168.1.29/db"
----

The previous example uses the `connectionURL` attribute that points to the required resource definition value that is to be projected as `uri`.

== Exposing entries of a collection with the key and value from each entry
The following example shows how to expose the entries of a collection with the key and value from each entry through annotations:

[#setting-annotations-mapping-to-be-optional] 
== Setting annotations mapping to be optional

You can have optional fields in the annotations. For example, a link to the credentials might not be there if the service endpoint does not require authentication. In such cases, a field might not exist in the target path of the annotations. As a result, the {servicebinding-title} generates an error, by default. As a service provider, to indicate whether you require annotations mapping, you can set a value to the `optional` flag in your annotations while enabling services.

{servicebinding-title} provides annotations mapping only if the target path is available. When the target path is not available the {servicebinding-title} skips providing the annotations mapping. 

.Procedure

. To enable {servicebinding-title} consider a new field in the annotations, provide the mapping by setting the `optional` flag value to `true`:

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.example.org/v1beta1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: my-db
  namespace: my-petclinic
  annotations:
    service.binding/username: path={.spec.name},optional=true
    ...
----

[NOTE]
====
* If you set the `optional` flag value to `false` and when the {servicebinding-title} is unable to find the target path, the Operator fails the annotations mapping.
* If there is no value set for the `optional` flag, the {servicebinding-title} considers the value as `false`, by default and fails the annotations mapping. 
====

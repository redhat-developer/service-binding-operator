                MySQL or CouchDB), messaging/queueing systems (such as RabbitMQ or
                Beanstalkd), SMTP services for outbound email (such as Postfix), and
                caching systems (such as Memcached).  Example 1: \tbackingServiceSelector:
                \t\tresourceKind: databases.example.org      resourceRef: mysql-database

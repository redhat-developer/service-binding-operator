Feature: Support a number of existing operator-backed services out of the box

  As a user of Service Binding operator
  I would like to be able to bind my application to a number of existing operator-backed services
  without a need to tweak their k8s resources

  Background:
    Given Namespace [TEST_NAMESPACE] is used
    * Service Binding Operator is running

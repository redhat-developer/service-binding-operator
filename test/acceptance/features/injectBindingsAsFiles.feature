Feature: Bindings get injected as files in application

    As a user of Service Binding Operator
    I want to make service binding data accessible to application
    through files available in application pods

    Background:
        Given Namespace [TEST_NAMESPACE] is used
        * Service Binding Operator is running

    Scenario: Binding is injected as files at the location of SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT env var
        Given Generic test application "generic-app-a-d-u-1" is running with binding root as "/var/data"
        * The Custom Resource is present

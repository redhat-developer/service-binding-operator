Feature: Bind an application to a service using annotations

    As a user of Service Binding Operator
    I want to bind application to services that expose bindable information
    via annotations placed on service's CRD or CR.

    Background:
        Given Namespace [TEST_NAMESPACE] is used
        * Service Binding Operator is running
    @disconnected

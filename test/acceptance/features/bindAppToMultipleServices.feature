Feature: Bind a single application to multiple services

    As a user of Service Binding operator
    I want to bind a single application to multiple services

    Background:
        Given Namespace [TEST_NAMESPACE] is used
        * Service Binding Operator is running
        * PostgreSQL DB operator is installed

    Scenario: Bind two backend services by creating 2 SBRs to a single application
        Given Imported Nodejs application "nodejs-app" is running
        * DB "db-demo-1" is running
        * DB "db-demo-2" is running
        * Service Binding Request is applied to connect the database and the application

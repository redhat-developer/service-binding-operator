# Binding an Imported app in one namespace to an In-cluster Operator Managed PostgreSQL Database in another namespace

## Introduction

This scenario illustrates binding an imported application in one namespace to an in-cluster operated managed PostgreSQL Database in another namespace.

Note that this example app is configured to operate with OpenShift 4.5 or newer.

## Actions to Perform by Users in 2 Roles

In this example there are 2 roles:

* Cluster Admin - Installs the operators to the cluster
* Application Developer - Imports a Node.js application, creates a DB instance, creates a request to bind the application and DB (to connect the DB and the application).

### Cluster Admin

The cluster admin needs to install 2 operators into the cluster:

* Service Binding Operator
* Backing Service Operator

A Backing Service Operator that is "bind-able," in other
words a Backing Service Operator that exposes binding information in secrets, config maps, status, and/or spec
attributes. The Backing Service Operator may represent a database or other services required by
applications. We'll use [postgresql-operator](https://github.com/operator-backing-service-samples/postgresql-operator) to
demonstrate a sample use case.

#### Install the Service Binding Operator

Navigate to the `Operators`->`OperatorHub` in the OpenShift console and in the `Developer Tools` category select the `Service Binding Operator` operator

and install the `beta` version.

This makes the `ServiceBinding` custom resource available, that the application developer will use later.

#### Install the DB operator using a `CatalogSource`

Apply the following `CatalogSource`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f - << EOD
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
    name: sample-db-operators
    namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
    sourceType: grpc
    image: quay.io/redhat-developer/sample-db-operators-olm:v1
    displayName: Sample DB Operators
EOD
```

Then navigate to the `Operators`->`OperatorHub` in the OpenShift console and in the `Database` category select the `PostgreSQL Database` operator

and install a `beta` version.

This makes the `Database` custom resource available, that the application developer will use later.

### Application Developer

#### Create one namespace called `service-binding-demo-1`

The application would be in a namespace `service-binding-demo-1`:


```shell
kubectl create namespace service-binding-demo-1
```

#### Import an application

In this example we will import an arbitrary [Node.js application](https://github.com/pmacik/nodejs-rest-http-crud).

In the OpenShift Console switch to the Developer perspective. (Make sure you have selected the `service-binding-demo-1` project). Navigate to the `+Add` page from the menu and then click on the `[From Git]` button. Fill in the form with the following:

* `Project` = `service-binding-demo-1`
* `Git Repo URL` = `https://github.com/pmacik/nodejs-rest-http-crud`
* `Builder Image` = `Node.js`
* `Application Name` = `nodejs-app`
* `Name` = `nodejs-app`

* `Select the resource type to generate` = Deployment
* `Create a route to the application` = checked


and click on the `[Create]` button.

Notice, that during the import no DB config was mentioned or requestd.

When the application is running navigate to its route to verify that it is up. Notice that in the header it says `(DB: N/A)`. That means that the application is not connected to a DB and so it should not work properly. Try the application's UI to add a fruit - it causes an error proving that the DB is not connected.

#### Create a DB instance for the application in another namespace

Now create another namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace service-binding-demo-2
```

Now we utilize the DB operator that the cluster admin has installed. To create a DB instance just create a `Database` custom resource in the `service-binding-demo-2` namespace called `db-demo`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f - << EOD
---
apiVersion: postgresql.baiju.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: db-demo
  namespace: service-binding-demo-2
spec:
  image: docker.io/postgres
  imageName: postgres
  dbName: db-demo
EOD
```

#### Express an intent to bind the DB and the application

Now, the only thing that remains is to connect the DB and the application. We let the Service Binding Operator to 'magically' do the connection for us.

Create the following `ServiceBinding`:

``` shell
kubectl apply -f - << EOD
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: binding-request
  namespace: service-binding-demo-1
spec:
  application:
    name: nodejs-app
    group: apps
    version: v1
    resource: deployments
  services:
  - group: postgresql.baiju.dev
    version: v1alpha1
    kind: Database
    name: db-demo
    namespace: service-binding-demo-2
EOD
```

There are 2 parts in the request:

* `application` - used to search for the application based on the name that we set earlier and the `group`, `version` and `resource` of the application to be a `Deployment`.
* `services` - used to find the backing service - our operator-backed DB instance called `db-demo` residing in a namespace other than that of the imported application.

That causes the application to be re-deployed.

Once the new version is up, go to the application's route to check the UI. In the header you can see `(DB: db-demo)` which indicates that the application is connected to a DB and its name is `db-demo`. Now you can try the UI again but now it works!

That's it, folks!
